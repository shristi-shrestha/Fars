The purpose of this assessment was to combine skills of creating, writing, documenting, and testing an R package with releasing that package on GitHub. In this assessment take the R files from Week 2's assessment about documentation and putting that file in an R package. 

For this assessment you must

- write a vignette to include in your package using knitr and R Markdown

- write at least one test written using testthat

- put your package on GitHub

- set up the repository so that the package can be checked and built on Travis

- Once your package has built on Travis and the build is passing with no errors, warnings, or notes you should add your Travis badge to the README.md file of your package repository.


### Data Source

This package analyzes data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. Users can read a csv, subset data by month/year, summarise accident occurrence for specific time and visualize the result in a US map by state.
